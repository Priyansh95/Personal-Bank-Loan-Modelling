# Personal-Bank-Loan-Modelling
This project deals comprehensive analysis of personal bank loan modeling, employing various machine learning algorithms. The project delves into data analysis and employs logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and AdaBoost techniques.Through rigorous examination, it provides insights into credit risk assessment and lending strategies.
## Dataset
The dataset is taken from the kaggle. we will solve a problem for classifying personal loans on the **Thera-Bank dataset**. The majority of Thera-Bank's customers are depositors. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in quickly expanding this base to do more loan business while earning more through loan interest. In particular, management wants to look for ways to convert its liability customers into retail loan customers while keeping them as depositors. A campaign the bank ran last year for deposit customers showed a conversion rate of over 9.6% success. This has prompted the retail marketing department to develop campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success rate with a minimal budget. The department would like to develop a classifier that will help them identify the potential customers who are more likely to purchase the loan. This will increase the success rate while reducing the cost of the campaign.
